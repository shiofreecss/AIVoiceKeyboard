- 1.5+ GB free disk space (for Whisper medium model)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the application

### Setting Up Whisper

The application uses OpenAI's Whisper for high-quality speech recognition in String Mode. The first time you use Whisper:

1. Download the Whisper model file from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-medium.bin)
2. Place the downloaded `ggml-medium.bin` file in the application's executable directory (typically `VoiceToKeyboard/bin/Debug/net8.0-windows/`)
3. The medium model (1.5GB) is set as default for best accuracy. You can also use smaller models like `ggml-tiny.bin` (75MB) or `ggml-small.bin` (450MB) by changing the source code if needed.

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Select the desired input mode:
   - **Command Mode**: For executing keyboard commands
   - **String Mode**: For typing spoken text
3. Check "Use AI Recognition" for more accurate speech recognition (requires model file)
4. Click "Start Listening" button
5. In String Mode, a green "SPEAKING NOW - PLEASE TALK" indicator will appear when you can speak
6. Speak your commands or text - words will appear as you speak
7. The recognized speech will be displayed in the text area and typed automatically in real-time
8. Use the scrollbar to view longer text and the "Copy Text" button to copy to clipboard
9. Click "Stop Listening" to pause voice recognition

## New Features in v1.0.2

### Real-time Word-by-Word Recognition
- Words appear as you speak them, without waiting for full sentences
- Faster response time with reduced audio capture length (2.5s vs 5s)
- Immediate visual feedback as each word is recognized
- Significantly reduced latency between speaking and text appearing

### Visual Speaking Indicator
- A green "SPEAKING NOW - PLEASE TALK" indicator appears when the system is actively recording
- Helps you know exactly when to speak for optimal recognition
- Accompanied by a green dot indicator in the status area

### Scrollable Text Display
- All recognized text is shown in a scrollable text box
- Automatically scrolls to show the latest text
- Allows reviewing longer dictation sessions

### Copy and Clear Functionality
- "Copy Text" button to copy all recognized text to clipboard
- Right-click context menu with Copy, Select All, and Clear options

## Tips for Better Recognition

- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Use a good quality microphone in a quiet environment
- For Command Mode, use exact command phrases
- In String Mode, speak one word at a time for best real-time results
- Wait for the "SPEAKING NOW" indicator to appear before talking
- The medium model provides better accuracy but requires more system resources
- For faster word recognition with slightly lower accuracy, try the small model
